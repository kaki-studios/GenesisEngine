# C++ 3D game engine
This is a 3D game engine written in C++. Dependencies:
- bgfx (rendering backend)
- SDL3 (windowing)
- glm (math)

## Usage
Build the demo using cmake, like this:
`cmake -S . -B build` and `cmake --build build --config Release`

## Notes
Mainly for testing, also I need a name for the engine
